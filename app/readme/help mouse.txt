Mouse shortcuts

Multi-carets:

    Ctrl+click - add/remove caret.
    Ctrl+drag - add caret with selection.
    Ctrl+Shift+click - add carets column in several lines (from previous caret to clicked line).

Dragging:

    Alt+drag - select vertical (column) block.
      Note: it may look weird if word-wrap on, because wrap is not considered here at all.
      Simple rectangle of coordinates [x1,y1]-[x2,y2] is always selected, even if this gives
      bad looking screen.
    drag on gutter's line numbers - select by entire lines.
    double-click and immediately drag - select text by words.

Clicks:

    double-click - select clicked word (see option word_chars).
    triple-click - select entire line (limited by end-of-lines).

    middle-button click (with option mouse_mid_click_scroll) - start "Browser Scroll" mode:
      circle mark appears and mouse moving around this mark auto-scrolls text in 4 directions;
      speed of scrolling depends on distance of cursor from circle mark (any click to turn off).

    middle-button click (with option mouse_mid_click_paste) - paste from clipboard.
      This is like in Linux. Additionally it's good to install plugin "Auto-Copy to Clipboard".

Misc:

    Alt+click (with option mouse_goto_definition) - call "Goto definition" command (if plugin installed).
    Shift+Alt+click - make vertical (column) selection, from first caret to clicked position.
    Shift+ scroll mouse wheel - scroll text horizontally.
    Ctrl+ scroll mouse wheel (with option mouse_wheel_zoom) - zoom text in/out.
    Ctrl+ scroll mouse wheel - on picture preview panel - zooms picture in/out.
    Ctrl+ drag-drop selected block - copy this block, instead of move it.
